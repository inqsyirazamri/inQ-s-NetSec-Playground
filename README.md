A hands-on Network Security Lab Repository focused on practical implementations using Cisco products and open-source firewall technologies like pfSense, complemented by GNS3 and Wireshark for advanced simulation and traffic analysis. This repository serves as a personal playground for understanding security features across multiple OSI layers.

## **Overview**
This repo contains configurations, simulations, and analysis files that demonstrate:
*   **Layer 2 Security**: Port Security, STP Security, VLAN Security.
*   **Layer 3 & 4 Security**: Standard and Extended IPv4 ACLs, Site-to-Site IPsec VPN.
*   **Layer 7 Security**: AAA with TACACS+ and RADIUS.
*   **Edge Security**: Cisco ASA configuration for NAT, DHCP, SSH, DMZ access.
*   **Threat Analysis**: Packet capture and filtering using Wireshark in GNS3.
*   **Layered Defense**: pfSense firewall with Snort IDS/IPS and rule tuning.

## **Tools Used**
*   **Cisco Packet Tracer** – Network simulation and configuration.
*   **GNS3 + VMware** – Advanced network emulation and integration.
*   **Wireshark** – Packet capture and filtering for threat analysis.
*   **pfSense + Snort** – Firewall and IDS/IPS for layered security.

## **Learning Objectives**
*   Understand and implement security controls across OSI layers.
*   Configure ACLs, VPNs, NAT, DHCP, and AAA for secure network design.
*   Analyze network traffic to detect anomalies and potential attacks.
*   Deploy layered security using firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

## **Highlights**
*   ISP-assigned public IP space for NAT and DMZ configurations.
*   ASA as the first line of defense for internal networks.
*   Realistic threat detection scenarios using Wireshark and Snort.
